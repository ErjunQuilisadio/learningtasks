<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
  <li>500g of Cheap Beef Pieces (stewing steak usually is cheap)</li>
  <li>500 mls of Real Ale</li>
  <li>4 Large Onions</li>
  <li>2 Fat Cloves of Garlic</li>
  <li>Tbsp of Plain Flour</li>
</ul>
<h2>Methods</h2>
    <ol>
  <li>Raw beef, roll it in the flour... fry 4-5 pieces at a time in a hot saucepan
  to seal... put to one side when all done</li>
  <li>Cut the onions into quarters... fry in the same frying pan as the beef... to soak up
  the juices.</li>
  <li>Towards the end of frying the onion (they should be nicely brown round the edges)
  throw in the smashed up cloves of garlic.</li>
  <li>Transfer the beef, onions, garlic to a deep casserole dish. Stir in the remaining flour</li>
  <li>Pour on the bottle of bear - really, it isn't going to be wasted!</li>
  <li>Cover, and cook at 150 for about 2 and a half hours... will be gorgeous when it
  comes out, trust me... serve with mash</li>
</ol>
